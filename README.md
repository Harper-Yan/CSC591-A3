CUDA-Parallel K-means clustering

This repo stores the py files, visualized results and excution logs that sotres the running time for k-means clustering algorithm implemented by four different methods:
1. CPU sequential method.
   
3. GPU multithreading method.
4. GPU multithreading without using shared memory.
5. GPU multithreading using shared memory.
